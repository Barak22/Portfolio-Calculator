# Portfolio-Calculator

Plan:
1. Collect several indexes files in resources/market-portfolio
2. Calculate and return a matrix with the return per month for each index
3. Calculate the Cov between two indexes
4. This is the most difficult part - calculate a vector of the weight of each index
that meets the minimum variance of the portfolio and the desired return.
